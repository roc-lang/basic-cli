These are examples of how to make basic CLI (command-line interface) programs using `basic-cli` as a platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - If you want to run an example here but don't want to build basic-cli from source; go to the examples of a specific version: https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/tree/0.VERSION.0/examples and in the example; replace the `"../platform/main.roc"` with the release link, for example `"https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/releases/download/0.19.0/Hj-J_zxz7V9YurCSTFcFdu6cQJie4guzsPMUi5kBYUk.tar.br"`. Next, run with `roc ./examples/YOUREXAMPLE.roc`.
> - To use these examples as is with basic-cli built from source you'll need to [build the platform first](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#running-locally).

Feel free to ask [on Zulip](https://roc.zulipchat.com) in the `#beginners` channel if you have questions about making
CLI programs, or if there are functions you'd like to see added to this platform (for
an application you'd like to build in Roc).
