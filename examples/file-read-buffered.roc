# Buffered File Reading
#
# Instead of reading an entire file and storing all of it in memory,
# like with File.readUtf8, you may want to read it in parts.
# A part of the file is stored in a buffer.
# Typically you process a part and then you ask for the next one.
#
# This can be useful to process large files without using a lot of RAM or
# requiring the user to wait until the complete file is processed when they
# only wanted to look at the first page.
#
# See examples/file-read.roc if you want to read the full contents at once.
