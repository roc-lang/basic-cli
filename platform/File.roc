## Tag union of possible errors when reading and writing a file or directory.
##
## **NotFound** - An entity was not found, often a file.
##
## **PermissionDenied** - The operation lacked the necessary privileges to complete.
##
## **BrokenPipe** - The operation failed because a pipe was closed.
##
## **AlreadyExists** - An entity already exists, often a file.
##
## **Interrupted** - This operation was interrupted. Interrupted operations can typically be retried.
##
## **Unsupported** - This operation is unsupported on this platform. This means that the operation can never succeed.
##
## **OutOfMemory** - An operation could not be completed, because it failed to allocate enough memory.
##
## **Other** - A custom error that does not fall under any other I/O error kind.
Err : InternalIOErr.IOErr

## Write data to a file.
##
## First encode a `val` using a given `fmt` which implements the ability [Encode.EncoderFormatting](https://www.roc-lang.org/builtins/Encode#EncoderFormatting).
##
## For example, suppose you have a `Json.toCompactUtf8` which implements
## [Encode.EncoderFormatting](https://www.roc-lang.org/builtins/Encode#EncoderFormatting).
## You can use this to write [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
## data to a file like this:
##
## ```
## # Writes `{"some":"json stuff"}` to the file `output.json`:
## File.write!
##     { some: "json stuff" }
##     (Path.from_str "output.json")
##     Json.toCompactUtf8
## ```
##
## This opens the file first and closes it after writing to it.
## If writing to the file fails, for example because of a file permissions issue, the task fails with [WriteErr].
##
## > To write unformatted bytes to a file, you can use [File.write_bytes!] instead.
## >
## > [Path.write!] does the same thing, except it takes a [Path] instead of a [Str].

## Writes bytes to a file.
##
## ```
## # Writes the bytes 1, 2, 3 to the file `myfile.dat`.
## File.write_bytes! [1, 2, 3] (Path.from_str "myfile.dat")
## ```
##
## This opens the file first and closes it after writing to it.
##
## > To format data before writing it to a file, you can use [File.write!] instead.
## >
## > [Path.write_bytes!] does the same thing, except it takes a [Path] instead of a [Str].

## Writes a [Str] to a file, encoded as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).
##
## ```
## # Writes "Hello!" encoded as UTF-8 to the file `myfile.txt`.
## File.write_utf8! "Hello!" "myfile.txt"
## ```
##
## This opens the file first and closes it after writing to it.
##
## > To write unformatted bytes to a file, you can use [File.write_bytes!] instead.
## >
## > [Path.write_utf8!] does the same thing, except it takes a [Path] instead of a [Str].

    Path.write_utf8! str (Path.from_str path)

## Deletes a file from the filesystem.
##
## Performs a [`DeleteFile`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-deletefile)
## on Windows and [`unlink`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlink_(Unix)) on
## UNIX systems. On Windows, this will fail when attempting to delete a readonly
## file; the file's readonly permission must be disabled before it can be
## successfully deleted.
##
## ```
## # Deletes the file named `myfile.dat`
## File.delete! (Path.from_str "myfile.dat") [1, 2, 3]
## ```
##
## > This does not securely erase the file's contents from disk; instead, the operating
## system marks the space it was occupying as safe to write over in the future. Also, the operating
## system may not immediately mark the space as free; for example, on Windows it will wait until
## the last file handle to it is closed, and on UNIX, it will not remove it until the last
## [hard link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) to it has been deleted.
## >
## > [Path.delete!] does the same thing, except it takes a [Path] instead of a [Str].

## Reads all the bytes in a file.
##
## ```
## # Read all the bytes in `myfile.txt`.
## File.read_bytes! "myfile.txt"
## ```
##
## This opens the file first and closes it after reading its contents.
##
## > To read and decode data from a file, you can use `File.read` instead.
## >

##
## ```
## # Reads UTF-8 encoded text into a Str from the file "myfile.txt"
## File.read_utf8! "myfile.txt"
## ```
##
## This opens the file first and closes it after writing to it.

## Creates a new hard link on the filesystem.
##
## The link path will be a link pointing to the original path.
## Note that systems often require these two paths to both be located on the same filesystem.
